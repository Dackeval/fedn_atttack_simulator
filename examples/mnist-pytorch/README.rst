Fedn MNIST Simulator

A lightweight reference implementation for running end‚Äëto‚Äëend federated learning experiments on the MNIST dataset using FEDn.

1. Quick¬†Start¬†(in 60‚ÄØseconds üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)

# Clone and enter the repo
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/<repo>.git
cd <repo>

# Create an isolated Python env
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Split the MNIST data set into 10 IID balanced partitions
python tools/split_mnist.py \
  --n_splits 10 \
  --iid iid \
  --balanced balanced

# Start the simulator
(Before running the simulator, make sure you have a MinIO/S3 bucket set up, the environment variables below configured and package and seed model uploaded to FEDn Studio (see section 5).)

python test_simulation.py

By default the first run stores the partitions on disk only.Add --push to the command above to automatically upload them to your MinIO/S3 bucket (see section 4).

2. Prerequisites

Tool

Tested version

Install

Python

3.12.7

https://www.python.org/downloads/

PyTorch

2.2.2

pip install torch==2.2.2

FEDn CLI

latest

pip install fedn

Helm

v3.17.1

https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/

kubectl

v1.31.3

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/

‚ö†Ô∏è  The simulator should also work with newer versions, but the above are verified.

3. Dataset¬†&¬†Partitions

The simulator expects each client‚Äôs MNIST partition to be located either

Locally inside the container at/app/data/mnist/<IID>_<BALANCED>/clients/<CLIENT_ID>/mnist.pt, or

Remotely in your object store under the same key.

On start‚Äëup data.py tries the local path first and‚Äîif the file is missing‚Äîdownloads it from MinIO/S3 using the variables listed below.

Required environment variables

Variable

Example

Description

DATA_ENDPOINT

minio:9000

MinIO/S3 endpoint (host:port)

DATA_ACCESS_KEY

minioadmin

Object‚Äëstore access key

DATA_SECRET_KEY

minioadmin

Object‚Äëstore secret key

DATA_BUCKET_NAME

fedn

Bucket containing the partitions

CLIENT_ID

1

1‚Äëbased index of the simulated client

IID

iid

iid or noniid

BALANCED

balanced

balanced or unbalanced

Tip: These variables are automatically injected into every mnist‚Äësim client pod by the Helm chart. Edit values.yaml if you need different defaults.

Mounting a local volume (skip the download)

If you prefer not to rely on an object store you can mount a host directory at /app/data:

# values.yaml
volumeMounts:
  - name: mnist-data
    mountPath: /app/data
volumes:
  - name: mnist-data
    hostPath:
      path: /absolute/path/on/host/mnist
      type: Directory

After changing the values file, apply the update:

helm upgrade fedn charts/fedn -f values.yaml

Resulting object‚Äëstore layout

fedn (bucket)
‚îî‚îÄ mnist
   ‚îî‚îÄ <iid>_<balanced>
      ‚îî‚îÄ clients
         ‚îú‚îÄ 1
         ‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ mnist.pt
         ‚îú‚îÄ 2
         ‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ mnist.pt
         ‚îî‚îÄ ‚Ä¶

4. Configuration

All runtime parameters live in config.yaml under the top‚Äëlevel key simulation:. Below is the current schema together with default values and valid options.

Key concepts

Key

Purpose

attack_type

Selects the adversarial strategy executed by the malicious clients.

defense_type

Aggregation rule used by the combiner to mitigate attacks.

pushfetch_or_fetch

push ‚Äì the simulator first splits & uploads the MNIST data before training. fetch ‚Äì assumes partitions are already present in the bucket and simply downloads them.

late_client_*

Simulate straggler behaviour by having selected clients join after late_client_delay rounds.

Tip: You can override any value via environment variables, e.g. SIMULATION_ROUNDS=50 python test_simulation.py.

5. Running a Simulation

Package the client code and seed model

fedn package create --path client
fedn run build --path client

Upload to FEDn Studio

fedn studio login -u <user> -P <pwd> -H <studio_host>
fedn project set-context -id <project_id> -H <studio_host>
fedn model set-active -f model.npz -H <studio_host>

Launch the simulator

python test_simulation.py

You will be prompted for:

Whether to reuse existing data partitions or create & upload new ones.

A session name (e.g. mnist-iid-balanced-10c-2025-05-18).

FEDn spins up the aggregator, combiner, and client containers automatically.Progress is streamed to your terminal and is also visible in Studio.

6. Monitoring & Logs

FEDn Studio ‚Äì web UI for model lineage and metrics

kubectl get pods ‚Äì watch the Kubernetes pods.

7. Tear‚Äëdown

# Remove the simulated client pods/deployment (created by the simulator)
helm uninstall mnist-sim
